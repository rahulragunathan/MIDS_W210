## Introduction

We all love watching movies, but why are some movies popular while others fail to click with audiences? 
Pop culture is littered with both indie cult-classics and high-profile, big-budget flops, and it can be unclear what factors drive both of these phenomena.

MovieSeer is a tool to help greenlight a movie - to predict whether the movie would be a financial success. Just enter the details of your movie (plot, budget, director, actors, etc.) and MovieSeer will provide a prediction. We also provide a variety of ways to explore our dataset to understand how the various features impact profitability. 

This repository specifically walks through the process of creating the machine learning model behind MovieSeer.
