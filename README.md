## Introduction

We all love watching movies, but why are some movies popular while others fail to click with audiences? 
Pop culture is littered with both indie cult-classics and high-profile, big-budget flops, and it can be unclear what factors drive both of these phenomena.

MovieSeer is a tool to help greenlight a movie - to predict whether the movie would be a financial success. Just enter the details of your movie (plot, budget, director, actors, etc.) and MovieSeer will provide a prediction. We also provide a variety of ways to explore our dataset to understand how the various features impact profitability.

## The Data

All movie data was retrieved from Wikipedia.

## The Technology

MovieSeer was created using [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/).

Movie data was retrieved using the [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) library.

The machine learning model was created using the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Sci-Kit Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/).

The application is deployed and hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

## The Team

This was the final Capstone project as part of UC Berkeley's Masters of Information in Data Science (MIDS) Program.
